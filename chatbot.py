        {"keywords": ["stress", "management", "environment", "comfort"], "response": "Reducing environmental stress, overcrowding, and providing clean, comfortable bedding can help minimize mastitis risk."},
        {"keywords": ["chronic", "recurring", "persistent"], "response": "Chronic mastitis occurs when infections are not fully treated, leading to recurring inflammation and reduced milk production."},
        {"keywords": ["how", "treat", "steps"], "response": "To treat mastitis, consult a vet for antibiotics, apply warm compresses, ensure frequent milking, and keep the cow in a clean environment."},
        {"keywords": ["udder", "damage", "injury", "physical"], "response": "Physical injuries to the udder, such as cuts or bruises, increase susceptibility to mastitis and should be treated immediately."},
        {"keywords": ["bedding", "contamination", "cleanliness", "dirty"], "response": "Dirty bedding can harbor bacteria that cause mastitis, so itâ€™s important to regularly clean and replace bedding materials."},
